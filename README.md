## Description
COVID-19 has made us exercise social distancing, we need to keep distance
of around 6ft at all times, this could become an hassle specially during
buying daily groceries where we are forced to have hand interaction; me and  my project partner thought of what if we could use hand gesture recognition from a safe distance to buy groceries. This motivated us to try and train an
Artificial Intelligence based system that can recognize different hand gestures
We used OpenCV to capture the input from the webcam and
then separate the background from the foreground and to detect a hand with
various shapes denoting various symbols, we used Numpy to do the
classification.
